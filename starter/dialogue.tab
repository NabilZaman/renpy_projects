day0_73d67984	"Driver"	So, m'lord, you're a new student at the institute, huh?	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	7	"Driver" "[what]"
day0_0faae1ee		M'lord?	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	9	"[what]"
day0_a6134ffa	mc.says	Hmm? Oh, yeah I suppose I will be.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	13	mc.says "[what]"
day0_b6cdae74	"Driver"	Pretty unusual, having a pick-up like this. Not that it's my first time carrying a student up there or anything.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	15	"Driver" "[what]"
day0_19664384	mc.says	Really?	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	18	mc.says "[what]"
day0_c3a6d078		It was hard focusing on what the driver was saying when so much is happening all around the carriage.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	20	"[what]"
day0_f29e66f3		There was so much life, so much motion. It was like... well, magic.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	22	"[what]"
day0_5e6cd78e	"Driver"	It's just, you know, odd for one of you to be arriving on your own like this. Usually students will have their own retinue. And... more bags, you know?	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	24	"Driver" "[what]"
day0_9f99baa7	mc.says	Mmhmm, yeah.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	27	mc.says "[what]"
day0_206635d3		A child running right by us is carrying a stick rapidly changing in color with a stream of sparks flying off the end.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	29	"[what]"
day0_b45f718c	"Driver"	So... you must be one them uh, 'special cases', huh?	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	31	"Driver" "[what]"
day0_b952ec8e	mc.says	Might be.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	33	mc.says "[what]"
day0_e2e2713b		Special what?	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	35	"[what]"
day0_e47f291d	"Driver"	Too right, well, none of my business, that.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	37	"Driver" "[what]"
day0_65d2fffd		Whatever the driver was thinking, they got quiet after that, which let me focus on everything around us.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	39	"[what]"
day0_90874669		There were so many wonders on the street. A shop has a sign that spins on its own and reads a different slogan with each revolution.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	41	"[what]"
day0_85bfad09		And there! A woman has her baby in a carriage that seems to be pushing itself.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	44	"[what]"
day0_ff1a01d4	"Driver"	It always gets lively right before the start of a new term. Plenty to see in town.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	46	"Driver" "[what]"
day0_cd4532c0		The driver seemed to notice me gaping out the windows with a grin.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	48	"[what]"
day0_ba6112cd		I continue staring, nearly hanging out the window at one point to watch a fountain erupting with what appear to be flower petals that went off jus as we rode past.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	50	"[what]"
day0_e545267a	"Driver"	Well, I'm sure you'll be learning a lot up there. And we're not too far now.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	53	"Driver" "[what]"
day0_1f77d1c5		As we round the bend on the street I finally get a proper view at our destination: The Magical Institute of Qyburn	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	57	"[what]"
day0_d4d03dfd		Home to the most advanced magical research in the world.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	60	"[what]"
day0_e60d7c84		No one could see that castle bearing down on them and hang onto any shread of misplaced confidence. Visitors were at the mercy of the powers that reside here.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	62	"[what]"
day0_welcome_7da51e70		We finally make it to the entrance where the driver drops me off along with the lone bag that comprises all my wordly posessions.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	73	"[what]"
day0_welcome_466d54d8		I can hardly take a step inside the grand doors before I'm ambushed by an administrator.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	76	"[what]"
day0_welcome_98a36ab1	"Administrator"	Welcome to the institute! We hope your journey was a pleasant one?	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	78	"Administrator" "[what]"
day0_welcome_b463f8af	mc.says	Oh, it —	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	80	mc.says "[what]"
day0_welcome_c49f82d3	"Administrator"	May I see your invitation?	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	82	"Administrator" "[what]"
day0_welcome_d8a49a08		They deftly swipe the invitation from my hands just as I'm producing it from my pocket.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	84	"[what]"
day0_welcome_237d5e77	"Administrator"	Oh, very interesting. Yes, we've certainly been expecting you.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	86	"Administrator" "[what]"
day0_welcome_085b6d06	"Administrator"	Well I'd love to give you a tour of the grounds you'll be calling home, but it's dreadfully late already and you must be exhausted.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	86	"Administrator" "[what]"
day0_welcome_f8ef880f	"Administrator"	Let me lead you to where you'll be staying.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	86	"Administrator" "[what]"
day0_welcome_ca1c070d		They grabbed my arm with too much strength for someone with their frame and dragged me out the door I just came in.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	93	"[what]"
day0_welcome_571440c9	"Administrator"	Most of the students have already arrived and are resting in their rooms. Do try not to make any undue ruckus in the dormitories.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	96	"Administrator" "[what]"
day0_welcome_e5c72cbf	"Administrator"	As you should already be aware, tomorrow is the opening ceremony for the new term. That will be the first day of your new life here.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	96	"Administrator" "[what]"
day0_welcome_a71b5ff4	"Administrator"	For now here are the keys to your room. There is a strict curfew once classes begin but it would be wise for you to begin practicing it now.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	96	"Administrator" "[what]"
day0_welcome_34e98d7d		The dragging didn't stop until we got to the doorstep of my room.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	106	"[what]"
day0_welcome_dc12aae4	"Administrator"	Oh, how exciting! We expect great things from you, so be sure to get some rest.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	108	"Administrator" "[what]"
day0_welcome_1f57331a		Practically dumping me there, they finally let me go, and briskly walk away without ever letting me get a word in.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	112	"[what]"
day0_welcome_4a1d1bf2		Which is well enough. They were right that I was exhausted.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	112	"[what]"
day0_welcome_cb0277e5		Entering my new room, I drop my bag to the floor, not bothering to unpack, and let myself drop into the bed.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	112	"[what]"
day0_welcome_a0415b91		Between the excitement of everything I saw in town on the ride in and my nerves confronting the reality of actually being a student here, I'm worried that I won't be able to get any rest at all.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	112	"[what]"
day0_welcome_14f6ba25		On the other hand, the journey here had been long and it all seemed to be catching up with me now as I let out a yawn.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	112	"[what]"
day0_welcome_38cd0d38		What had they said? They "expect great things?"	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	112	"[what]"
day0_welcome_a398c7a0		I stifle another yawn as my eyelids grow heavy and I let sleep take me.	game/events/plot/prologue/day0.rpy	112	"[what]"
day1_morning_06da2d66		 I wake up the next morning just before sunrise, the still sore from travel. 	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	8	"[what]"
day1_morning_1b1b0549		I didn't have a chance to appreciate it last night but the bed in my room may be the nicest I've ever been in. I slept like a rock.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	14	"[what]"
day1_morning_8b926e65		I stretch and look outside. The sky is still dark but growing red with the coming sun. I can't see any activity from my window and I take a moment to just appreciate the quiet.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	14	"[what]"
day1_morning_762ba720		Today will be the opening ceremony but not for at least an hour more, so I decide to tidy up a bit.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	22	"[what]"
day1_morning_b769f0c8		After unpacking my two sets of clothes into a wardrobe large enough to make my collection feel inadequate, I turn to set up my personal effects on my desk:	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	22	"[what]"
day1_morning_bb30e3f8		A worn dagger that used to belong to my father, and a sharpening stone to maintain it.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	22	"[what]"
day1_morning_a81383e1		A clear crystal with a streak running through it strung on a cord - a protective charm from a merchant who had visited our home town years ago.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	22	"[what]"
day1_morning_060fde29		I don't wear it much anymore but it felt appropriate to bring whatever protection I could muster when leaving home to come here.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	22	"[what]"
day1_morning_eeb6faaf		Lastly I pull out a tattered leatherbound notebook. Somewhere between a diary and a sketchbook I use it regularly and it's showing its age. I'll need to pick up some more parchment for it in town.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	22	"[what]"
day1_morning_b07f138b		I pull out the last of my traveling rations from my sack and munch on it as I look back outside.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	43	"[what]"
day1_morning_dcd1d9be		The sun has stubbornly refused to budge in the sixty seconds it took me to unpack so I decide to explore the dormitory.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	43	"[what]"
day1_morning_fb8924f7		I hear signs of life from other rooms as others are starting to wake. I don't feel like I have the courage needed to endure a run-in with my neighbors yet, so I move with haste to a quieter section of the building.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	43	"[what]"
day1_morning_638a216d		A door standing ajar catches my attention and I peek through to find not another bedroom but what appears to be a series of raised washbasins mounted to the wall.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	43	"[what]"
day1_morning_0d0dfc4f		I approach with curiosity and just as I'm leaning in to get a closer look at the aparatus it springs to life with water running down into the basin, and down a hole in the base.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	60	"[what]"
day1_morning_e5a5790b		I can't help but release a yelp in surprise and rush out the room the way I came in.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	60	"[what]"
day1_morning_5ef367d4		 I'm crouching in the hall, peaking back into the room, fearing that I've triggered some magical alarm system, when I notice I'm no longer alone. 	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	70	"[what]"
day1_morning_f359659d	ag.says	Are you ok there? {i}*snicker*{/i}	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	79	ag.says "[what]"
day1_morning_5adf3c5f		She seems to be trying, not very successfully, to stifle laughter after catching me... well I'm not sure what I've done wrong yet but I'd prefer to not get in trouble for it.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	81	"[what]"
day1_morning_c04aee07	mc.says	Ok? Me? I'm great. Why wouldn't I be ok?	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	88	mc.says "[what]"
day1_morning_3bffaa9d	ag.says	Oh, pardon me, you just seemed a bit alarmed, is all.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	90	ag.says "[what]"
day1_morning_cc0d134b	mc.says	Oh, I'm fine, yep. I was just, uh, making sure no one snuck in there.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	93	mc.says "[what]"
day1_morning_f492b5d3	ag.says	Snuck in? I imagine anyone who's made it on campus is welcome to use the facilities.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	95	ag.says "[what]"
day1_morning_3232c5a6		Her smile fades and she looks a little puzzled before asking,	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	97	"[what]"
day1_morning_057e6283	ag.says	Have you never used a washroom before?	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	99	ag.says "[what]"
day1_morning_a4496c81		A washroom? So this room is for washing things, probably powered by some magic?	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	101	"[what]"
day1_morning_b7c9cecf		Swallowing my pride as it doesn't seem like maintaining a bluff will get me anywhere,	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	103	"[what]"
day1_morning_4b65a5d2	mc.says	Honestly, no, I've never heard of one before now.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	105	mc.says "[what]"
day1_morning_fb6d68a4		A look of shock quickly passes over her face before being replaced by a twinkle of excitement in her eyes.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	107	"[what]"
day1_morning_e7d531f3	ag.says	That's surprsing; they're such marvelous conveniences!	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	109	ag.says "[what]"
day1_morning_dba697bc		She grabs my arm and pulls me back into the room and shows me how getting near the basin causes the device above it to start emitting a fountain of water.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	111	"[what]"
day1_morning_6b366e9e	ag.says	The basis is a fairly standard water artifice hidden behind the wall with some clever engineering to funnel the watter the right way without causing a mess. The real genius, however, is how newer installations react to your mana to immediately begin dispensing when you approach.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	114	ag.says "[what]"
day1_morning_89d25e74	ag.says	I thought you might have never used an automatic one before, which was alarming the first time I tried one as a child... but to think you've never used a washroom before.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	114	ag.says "[what]"
day1_morning_144347a4	ag.says	I know the technology's only a few decades old, but I've grown up with them my whole life so it's such hardship when I have do without while traveling.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	114	ag.says "[what]"
day1_morning_87fd7b2c	ag.says	What house are you from that doesn't have washrooms in their estate?	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	114	ag.says "[what]"
day1_morning_ff4fd54a		What house? My confusion seems to show as she interjects:	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	127	"[what]"
day1_morning_1dd7fbfb	ag.says	Oh where are my manners? I'm [ag.name()], of house [ag.family_name].	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	131	ag.says "[what]"
day1_morning_a1fbdb0d		It finally clicks. She's nobility. I have no idea what the etiquette is around introductions but she doesn't look like she'll take any transgression personally.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	133	"[what]"
day1_morning_d05b0922	mc.says	I'm [mc.name()] of Karnsley. I'm afraid I don't belong to any of the noble houses.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	136	mc.says "[what]"
day1_morning_34c92319	ag.says	Oh, wow. I'm sorry for jumping to conclusions. Are you employed by the academy?	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	138	ag.says "[what]"
day1_morning_6cc985b5	mc.says	I'm actually a student, or will be once the term start.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	140	mc.says "[what]"
day1_morning_f69e6e9b	ag.says	Really? I didn't realize the school admitted commoners. Well I've made a fool of myself.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	142	ag.says "[what]"
day1_morning_7d116cb6	mc.says	True, the only way you could look more foolish is if I had caught you panicking over being caught tresspassing by an automatic washbasin,	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	144	mc.says "[what]"
day1_morning_c0a037d8		I reply with a grin and we both laugh off the awkward circumstances of our meeting.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	147	"[what]"
day1_morning_8b1641af		I was apprehensive about how to interact with other students here, but I'm totally disarmed by how friendly [ag.name()] has been.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	149	"[what]"
day1_morning_86609ea1	ag.says	Ok, in that case, I {i}have{/i} to show you the toilets. This is going to change your life.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	152	ag.says "[what]"
day1_morning_4191c3da		She drags me back into the washroom to show me several other wonders and we spend a while together, her excitedly describing the workings of the artifice mechanisms involved, and me mostly just trying to keep up.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	155	"[what]"
day1_morning_c249b611		Apparently the school also has indoor bath houses, though they're in detached buildings due to the complexity of drawing and draining that much water.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	155	"[what]"
day1_morning_fa04e1b9		By the time we're through, the sun has fully risen and there's plenty of motion around the door as students prepare for the day.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	155	"[what]"
day1_morning_6df66d63	ag.says	Shoot, I need to get ready if I'm going to be in time for the opening ceremony. It was a pleasure meeting you, [mc.name()].	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	167	ag.says "[what]"
day1_morning_64b1370c		So we part ways and I join the throng of students heading their way to the auditorium.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	170	"[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_45d3434d		I've taken my seat in the auditorium amongst what seem to be over a hundred other students.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	180	"[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_af9c1ee1		A few stragglers are still trickling in but it seems like the ceremony is getting ready to begin.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	180	"[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_dce36e30		An elderly man makes his way onto the central podium on the stage. He's clearly quite frail but somehow manages to exude power at the same time.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	189	"[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_f6d19a16		All the chatter dies down.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	189	"[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_cf3ad408	hm.says	{size=72}{cps=20}POTENTIA UTENDEM EST!{/cps}{/size}	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	195	hm.says "[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_60b8e093		The old man roars, far louder than should be possible, and no hint of frailty remains in his frame.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	197	"[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_99f61d60	hm.says	These are the words of our institution. These are the words we will instill in you. And if you expect to survive here, these are the words you must live by.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	199	hm.says "[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_20c00bcb	hm.says	First, you must know who we are.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	199	hm.says "[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_c275fc6f	hm.says	We are not spiritual theoreticians like you will find in the institutions of the east.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	199	hm.says "[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_564c499a	hm.says	We are not diviners and supplicants to the spirits as you will find in the temples to the south.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	199	hm.says "[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_8088c8c3	hm.says	Who are we? We are the Magi. The practitioners of magic. We do not fear our own power for we understand how to use it. How to bend and reshape the world into a better one.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	199	hm.says "[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_5501d2db	hm.says	Starting from this day, you too will be magi.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	199	hm.says "[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_94dd0d65	hm.says	Oh, aspirants of the spiritual arts, stray souls seeking to drink from the font of knowledge, be welcome here. But know that this knowledge you seek comes at a price.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	199	hm.says "[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_292fbb41	hm.says	You will work and you will grow, for we will work you and we will grow you. We will mold you into the magi of tomorrow and you will be greater than anything that has come before.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	199	hm.says "[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_c1fd9e6a	hm.says	But as you grow in power so too will you grow in your duty to put that power to use. There is no greater sin than the inaction of the powerful.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	199	hm.says "[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_889afd2e	hm.says	And once your time is done here you will take what we teach you back to your homes, to your lands, to the far corners of the world and you will put it to use.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	199	hm.says "[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_af703c11		And then there is a long pause. The old man appears to almost shrink he no longer imposes the same aura as before, but everone is still a bit shaken by that performance.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	228	"[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_7ebf5ec4	hm.says	And with that let's call the ceremony bit of this pageant done eh? Hoh oh oh oh oh.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	231	hm.says "[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_2bc87914	hm.says	In case you haven't gathered it yet, I am the Headmaster at the Qyburn Institute of Magic.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	235	hm.says "[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_6f46e0bc	hm.says	Now for a few logistical matters. You are all the 238th class at this hallowed institution. Or rather you will be.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	235	hm.says "[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_42053f67	hm.says	While you're all gathered here to study at the academy, ultimately, not all of you will be joining as students.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	235	hm.says "[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_2bf6ef9a	hm.says	How do I mean? Well as of today you are all prospects. For one week our esteemed faculty will be conducting lessons in the fundamentals we expect all our students to master.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	235	hm.says "[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_f06f1cd8	hm.says	Some of you may have arrived with prior study such that you already feel you have no need for such lessons. I caution that you act on your hubris at your own peril.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	235	hm.says "[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_46b8a151	hm.says	At the end of the this week we will be holding a qualifying exam, and as is fitting our words, there will be a practical component that will demand you to apply what you learn.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	235	hm.says "[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_2f0dd790	hm.says	If you pass this qualifying exam, or "Quals" as your peers have taken to calling it, you will be inducted as full students of the academy.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	235	hm.says "[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_085fedf3	hm.says	If we find you lack the aptitude necessary to succeed here, we will ask you to leave.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	235	hm.says "[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_867acbc3		My heart sinks into my stomach. There's a exam in one week? I don't know the first thing about magic and it seems like more than half the students here have had some private instruction before coming here.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	259	"[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_de1dfeae	hm.says	Oh, and one last thing.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	263	hm.says "[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_8dd07552	hm.says	I want to take this moment to call attention to a program we run at this institute. In keeping with our words, every year we partner with the esteemed guilds in the city to admit a handful of guild-sponsored students.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	263	hm.says "[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_bc3e1562	hm.says	These students will be expected to immeidately put into practice what they learn here at the academy by reporting to their guild patrons for duties. They will of course have to balance this against their other coursework.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	263	hm.says "[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_ec4fbefd	hm.says	Each year we tend to have either one or two such students, but this year we have an unprecedented five. I for one look forward to such promising talent joining us for the schoolyear.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	263	hm.says "[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_fd9fa620	hm.says	And that's it! Enjoy the rest of your day off as classes begin tomorrow.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	263	hm.says "[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_bc7429b6		I join the crowd emptying out of the building, trying to process what I've signed up for.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	282	"[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_65ee2b2a		I'm one of those students sponsored by a guild that the headmaster mentioned at the end of his address. That part doesn't surprise me, I knew roughly what the deal was.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	282	"[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_13c0eacf		I've always been interested in magic and the spirits, I feel like I can see them from time to time, like after a rainfall or being carried by a particularly powerful squall.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	282	"[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_fa9e6e30		But I've never had any particular talent for it. I've never managed to cast any spells, I wouldn't know where to begin.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	282	"[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_90c4e92c		The only reason I'm here is that a friend of my mother had apparently made arrangements for me to attend this school through the Adventurer's guild.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	282	"[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_9ac49e63		I knew it was prestigious but I figured I had already been admitted so the hard part was over.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	282	"[what]"
day1_morning_opening_ceremony_84bdacbc		I make it as far as the stairs in front of the building, lost my my self-pity, before a staff member stops me to hand me a note. Apparently I'm to report to the Adventurer's guild today for orientation.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	300	"[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_de8abbca		It doesn't take me too long to find the guild. Most of the guild halls in town seem to be situated on the same street and this one is pretty prominent.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	314	"[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_5f724ccf	gr.says	Welcome to the Adventurer's guild! Have you come to petition the guild with a request?	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	319	gr.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_6ecb0c3a	mc.says	Hi. No I don't think so, I'm a student up at the academy and was told to report here.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	321	mc.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_7fb3e78b	gr.says	A student? I'm afraid I don't know —	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	323	gr.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_2adafde6	gr.says	Oh, that's right! Let me go fetch the guildmaster.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	325	gr.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_be8c893a		The receptionist leaves and I take a look around. It's early afternoon and the hall is mostly empty. I guess people don't linger for too long after they've finished their business here.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	327	"[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_8085ab98		The Adventurer's guild is a pretty well regarded institution, we even had a small branch back home.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	327	"[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_c57c3b0d		I've thought more than a few times about joining up with them as it always felt like a easy solution to the otherwise directionless life I've lead. But my mom wouldn't hear it.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	327	"[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_c38182a0		Come to think of it I'm surprised she was convinced to let me come to this school on a guild sponsorship.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	327	"[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_037d4bea	gm.says	Ah here you are. Damien's kid, right? I knew your father back in the day.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	344	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_58cd2813		I'm shocked to hear this. My dad died when I was pretty young and I honeslty don't know much about him.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	346	"[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_edcfd977		I remember him telling me stories of his adventures before bed that would fill my sleep with dreams of gallantry and heroism.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	346	"[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_50f2ddab		But after he died, no one would ever tell me how it happened. My mother wouldn't tolerate talk of him. All I know is that he had been on a particularly dangerous contract for the guild and didn't make it.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	346	"[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_75767171	gm.says	You probably already have a decent idea of how the guild works but your situation is a bit special so let's just start from the beginning and clear up any misconceptions you might be carrying.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	358	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_c730a69e	gm.says	First of all you are a student - not an adventurer. The guild isn't in the business of hiring minors and during your time acting on behalf of the guild you must understand that you do not have the rank and privileges of a full member of the guild.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	358	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_7bea135e	gm.says	That being said, your position is not without its perks.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	358	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_a47a866f	gm.says	You are from this day forward, provisional members of the Adventurer's Guild, and will be granted a provisional license.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	358	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_53a4a83f	gm.says	This process isn't all too dissimilar to what any prospective adventurer might go through if they walked into our halls and applied for membership. The difference is that your path from here to full membership is much more clearly prescribed:	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	358	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_56150624	gm.says	During your time in our care you'll perform contracts on behalf of the guild. Once you graduate, should you still be in good standing with us, you'll not only be inducted as a full fledged member of the Adventurer's guild, but you'll begin your career as a {b}class C{/b} adventurer.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	358	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_b2a13f1d	gm.says	This is a significant merit - most adventurers don't make it to class C without at least 10 years of experience under their belt, and very few ever find themselves promoted past this classification.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	358	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_8f3f6aee	gm.says	As a sponsored graduate from Qyburn you will find yourself quickly advancing through the guild ranks.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	358	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_b87b8629		She pauses to take a breath and steps over to grab a drink from a small bar tucked around the corner from the reception that I hadn't noticed until now.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	388	"[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_c3c55844	gm.says	Damn, you're making me talk today. Don't worry, we're almost through.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	391	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_b5f2bafb	gm.says	So where was I? Right, so all of that is contingent on your fullfillment of duties to the guild and remaining in good academic standing back at the adademy.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	391	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_5ced55d6	gm.says	A kid like you from a Podunk-backwater like Karnsley couldn't fathom the sums of money the guild is fronting to sponsor your tution up there.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	391	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_193af61d	gm.says	Part of that is paid for from the revenue you'll earn doing contracts, but you can't hope to earn enough to pay back that debt in full - and we don't expect you to.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	391	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_c761543f	gm.says	Instead the guild is making an investment in you as a promising young candidate for a future master adventurer. If we find you're not living up to that promise, we'll have no choice but to divest our investment in you.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	391	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_143b3125		She pauses to take another long drink and I can't make out what's in that dark red-brown liquid she has in her mug.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	408	"[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_b14c8e30	gm.says	Great. So having said all that, put it out of mind for now.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	413	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_0c136002	gm.says	There will be plenty of time for that once you're a full student at the academy, but you're no use to us if you don't pass your Quals.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	413	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventurers_guild_intro_11a3ccd6	gm.says	So report back here in a weeks time after you've {i}passed{/i} your exams, and we'll get you set up with a physical license and let you start taking on contracts.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	413	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventuers_guild_questions_fa0172b3	gm.says	Alright that's my whole spiel. Do you have any questions before we kick you out?	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	434	gm.says "[what]" nointeract
day1_afternoon_adventuers_guild_questions_67b7c25c	gm.says	I did.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	437	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventuers_guild_questions_710aa6e6	gm.says	Damien was equal parts a good man and a scoundrel, but he had a big heart and he loved you with all of it.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	437	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventuers_guild_questions_c659ede4	gm.says	He would go to unreasonable lengths to help those in front of him.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	437	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventuers_guild_questions_b7d0b6fc	gm.says	He had all these grand plans of making it big as an adventurer. Bringing back wealth and glory. He figured this was how he'd do right by you all.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	437	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventuers_guild_questions_472eb7d9	gm.says	But he didn't understand where his wife and kids needed him most was back home with them. And then he went and got himself killed.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	437	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventuers_guild_questions_b78509f5	gm.says	But there's no point in reminiscing on the past. Maybe if you can establish yourself more around here, I'll have more stories to tell about him.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	437	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventuers_guild_questions_6748167e	gm.says	Hah! Well you've got the right attitude, believe it or not. We're not a charity, and the guild collects payment for the contracts we fulfill.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	456	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventuers_guild_questions_e3ce82a7	gm.says	Based on your rank we have standard rate splits. For example a full Class E adventurer would generally expect to get a 60% split of the payout, which isn't bad considering it's costing us more to organize these contracts, facilitate the payments, and offer support to adventurers than we're making on that 40% cut.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	456	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventuers_guild_questions_e2dfd45d	gm.says	But we need you all to make enough to feed yourselves and stay off the streets while you hopefully get good enough to take on more difficult contracts.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	456	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventuers_guild_questions_bbbb122f	gm.says	Those contracts in turn are more lucrative so the guild needs to take less of a cut to cover our overheads. So at the higher ranks, the job pays pretty well.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	456	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventuers_guild_questions_563fe856	gm.says	Of course, we won't be anywhere near as generous with you. We're already paying for your cushy room as well as all the food you eat up there at the academy, not to mention the outrageous sums they charge for tuition.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	456	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventuers_guild_questions_00edb959	gm.says	So we'll be taking most of what you bring in from contracts so you can start paying back what we've invested in you.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	456	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_adventuers_guild_questions_37d3bdf9	gm.says	Still we'll leave you with some pocket change so you can afford to buy some candy after class.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	456	gm.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_post_guild_8e9ed585		After leaving the guild hall I note that it's well past midday now. This far north, it won't be long now until sunset.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	491	"[what]"
day1_afternoon_post_guild_899c4ecd		I feel my stomach grumbling as I realize I haven't had anything to eat since early morning.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	491	"[what]"
day1_afternoon_post_guild_1076d088	mc.says	Excuse me, can you point me to the nearest shrine to the spirits?	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	502	mc.says "[what]"
day1_afternoon_post_guild_1f508b4e	"Stranger1"	Sorry, I'm not sure...	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	504	"Stranger1" "[what]"
day1_afternoon_post_guild_1adaab54	"Stranger2"	A shrine? I don't think I've ever seen one around here.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	506	"Stranger2" "[what]"
day1_afternoon_post_guild_40818770	"Stranger3"	Sorry there aren't too many superstitious folks around here kid.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	508	"Stranger3" "[what]"
day1_afternoon_post_guild_97f74849		It takes several more tries before I find someone who can point me in the right direction	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	510	"[what]"
day1_afternoon_post_guild_fb4e2f9f	"Stranger17"	A shrine... yeah I swear I've seen one around somewhere. I think down that district there, a little ways past the residential blocks. There should be one over there.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	512	"Stranger17" "[what]"
day1_afternoon_post_guild_2a9b5661		And by the time I track it down it's been nearly two hours since I started and the sun is hanging low in the sky.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	515	"[what]"
day1_afternoon_market_lunch_5a1bd17a		I make my way to the market and follow my nose to the prepared food stalls.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	523	"[what]"
day1_afternoon_market_lunch_43afde24		There I'm met with a cavalcade of sights and sounds and smells of so many dishes being prepared.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	523	"[what]"
day1_afternoon_market_lunch_e03ecab3		I spend a while deliberating before settling on some dumplings and a fresh peach for dessert.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	523	"[what]"
day1_afternoon_market_lunch_2aa1b7ce		I find a quiet bench overlooking the river to enjoy my meal.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	533	"[what]"
day1_afternoon_market_lunch_4b8156d8		I feel like a lot's happened already and I should take this opportunity to take stock.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	533	"[what]"
day1_afternoon_market_lunch_08fa0052		Classes begin tomorrow but more importantly there's an exam at the end of the week that I need to make sure I'm prepared for.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	533	"[what]"
day1_afternoon_market_lunch_5afb0058		I have duties to the Adventurer's Guild, but that can wait until next week.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	533	"[what]"
day1_afternoon_market_lunch_42200587		And the guildmaster said they knew my father. This could be my chance to find out what happened to him and what kind of man he was.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	533	"[what]"
day1_afternoon_market_lunch_64b71ba2		Somewhere between the full stomach and laying out my concerns I feel a lot more in control.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	533	"[what]"
day1_afternoon_market_lunch_d495bd22		I also recall that there was one more thing I had been meaning to do in town today. I return to the market and pick up a few more peaches before starting on my last mission for the day.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	533	"[what]"
day1_night_shrine_intro_2fc91176		Back home it's pretty normal for people to show reverence to the spirits, and the shrine is a pretty prominent feature of the town.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	566	"[what]"
day1_night_shrine_intro_1956216b		I was never especially devout, but I was taught that whenever traveling you should pay respects to the local spirits and ask for their protection while visiting their domain.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	566	"[what]"
day1_night_shrine_intro_69b73892		It seems the people here have a different perspective towards the spirits, which feels odd because this city and everything that's made it so successful is built entirely on the power of the spirits.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	566	"[what]"
day1_night_shrine_intro_3717388e		Now that I approach the shrine, my offering of fresh peaches in tow, I take notice of how run-down the temple around it is.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	566	"[what]"
day1_night_shrine_intro_634f2d06		The main offering altar is well maintained but there are side buildings that look abandoned and unkempt.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	566	"[what]"
day1_night_shrine_intro_f070994a		It's so quiet that I feel like I'm intruding, but I gather up my courage and move to make my offering.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	566	"[what]"
day1_night_shrine_intro_294c7ac9	sk.says	Well now isn't this a surprise. What are you doing here young one?	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	589	sk.says "[what]"
day1_night_shrine_intro_a12f6500	mc.says	Good evening ma'am. I'm new to town and I'm here to pay my respects to the local spirits.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	591	mc.says "[what]"
day1_night_shrine_intro_95d304f2	sk.says	Have you now? And what have your brought the spirits this evening?	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	594	sk.says "[what]"
day1_night_shrine_intro_008af7dc	mc.says	Just some peaches from the market.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	596	mc.says "[what]"

day1_night_shrine_intro_9a5683f7	sk.says	How did you know peaches were my favorite?	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	608	sk.says "[what]"
day1_night_shrine_intro_bfdab4e7		I'm at a loss for words. This woman can't be an official here, she must be some vagrant who swipes offerings people leave here!	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	610	"[what]"
day1_night_shrine_intro_7ee61efc	sk.says	Hehehehe oh you must see the look on your face. Oh don't get your knickers in a knot, I'm just having some fun with you. 	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	613	sk.says "[what]"
day1_night_shrine_intro_49677807	mc.says	By stealing offerings from the shrine! Does noone in this city respect the spirits anymore?!	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	617	mc.says "[what]"
day1_night_shrine_intro_e97e5662		I don't know why this has me so heated. Somehow this moment was important to me. Some connection to home through similar ritual.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	620	"[what]"
day1_night_shrine_intro_71cc363c	sk.says	You should be old enough to know by now the spirits aren't sneaking in at night to whisk your offering away. At a more distinguished temple in the south the attendants might leave this offering out for a few days until the spoiling fruit threatens to injure the dignity of the shrine.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	623	sk.says "[what]"
day1_night_shrine_intro_1975dcdb	sk.says	At which point they'll throw it on a rubbish heap. Or perhaps at some of the more progressive sites they might collect the eddible offerings to donate to an orphanage.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	623	sk.says "[what]"
day1_night_shrine_intro_2cb748e3	sk.says	But don't you think to question my devotion to the spirits just beacuse I won't tolerate letting a prime peach go to waste!	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	623	sk.says "[what]"

day1_night_shrine_intro_d8160dfa	sk.says	Not that this place hasn't seen better days. But what am I to do? You can't fix up a temple with peaches alone, not that the locals bother offering even that much.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	643	sk.says "[what]"
day1_night_shrine_intro_de260e9e	sk.says	Look, I know you're not a bad kid. I didn't need to leap don't your throat like that.

day1_night_shrine_intro_42b20483	sk.says	As I've borne witness, the sprits accept and appreciate your offering, child. May they show you their favor, offer you their protection, and guide you with their wisdom during your stay here.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	643	sk.says "[what]"
day1_night_shrine_intro_d5761834	mc.says	Thank you, shrine keeper.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	658	mc.says "[what]"
day1_night_shrine_intro_a0e84bdd		I offer her a bow, but as I straighten again I feel a dizziness come over me, along with a thrumming in my ears.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	660	"[what]"
day1_night_shrine_intro_166a37bf		I have to support myself on a pillar to stop from falling as the thrumming grows, louder and more insistent.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	660	"[what]"
day1_night_shrine_intro_37446282		I can hear someone calling out to me, at the edges of my perception... the shrine keeper?	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	660	"[what]"
day1_night_shrine_intro_5aa0edc5		Then as quickly as it came, the sensation fades again. I'm sweating and shivering slightly but am already feeling much better, though I see the shrine keeper looking very concerned.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	660	"[what]"
day1_night_shrine_intro_6cc31ab0		Finding my balance again, I straighten up.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	660	"[what]"

day1_night_shrine_intro_40036aed		Then all at once it hits me again, like a tsunami, and I lose consciousness.	game/events/plot/prologue/day1.rpy	676	"[what]"
day2_ea475fc7	sn.says	Good morning sleepy head.	game/events/plot/prologue/day2.rpy	16	sn.says "[what]"
day2_9dbba12a	sn.says	You were brought in last night by a sweet old thing who was quite shook up with you collapsing on her.	game/events/plot/prologue/day2.rpy	16	sn.says "[what]"
day2_aaa167cd	sn.says	I looked you over and couldn't find a thing wrong with you, so I just let you sleep it off here.	game/events/plot/prologue/day2.rpy	16	sn.says "[what]"

day2_789077ff		I thank the nurse, embarrassed and rush back to my room to get ready.	game/events/plot/prologue/day2.rpy	30	"[what]"
day2_night_a7cd7568		I collapse into my bed at the end of the day, my mind still whirling with everything I've been learning.	game/events/plot/prologue/day2.rpy	39	"[what]"
day2_night_082a0303		Between classes where I'm already way behind the other students and having to report to the guild, I'm worried I won't last long here.	game/events/plot/prologue/day2.rpy	39	"[what]"
day2_night_8b6e2f53		But for now it's late and I'm plenty tired so I should try to quell my doubts and get to bed. I can already feel a headache coming on.	game/events/plot/prologue/day2.rpy	39	"[what]"
day2_night_1ee11aff		I close my eyes and begin to drift.	game/events/plot/prologue/day2.rpy	39	"[what]"
day2_night_dream_a20cefa7		...	game/events/plot/prologue/day2.rpy	57	"[what]"
day2_night_dream_148b4032		I feel... heat. And pain. My head throbs insistently. And there's a persistent thrumming in my ears.	game/events/plot/prologue/day2.rpy	57	"[what]"
day2_night_dream_1ae0a761		The thoughts are hard to pin down.	game/events/plot/prologue/day2.rpy	57	"[what]"
day2_night_dream_5d1e2712		The sensations fade as I finally settle into sleep.	game/events/plot/prologue/day2.rpy	57	"[what]"
day3_night_03ee146e		I make it back to my room at the end of the day, exhausted.	game/events/plot/prologue/day3.rpy	6	"[what]"
day3_night_3dcfb862		I'm surprised by how physically taxing channeling has proven, and my head still hasn't forgiven me for pushing myself so hard in class today.	game/events/plot/prologue/day3.rpy	6	"[what]"
day3_night_c361f663		The moon is bright enough to light up my room and I'm tempted to stay up a little bit longer.	game/events/plot/prologue/day3.rpy	6	"[what]"
day3_night_a66e123c		I had vague intentions of doing some attuning practice tonight, but I don't think my head can I can take much more today so I just pull the curtains shut.	game/events/plot/prologue/day3.rpy	6	"[what]"
day3_night_4786246e		I slide into bed, thankful the academy designed the accomodations to satisfy its primarily noble student body, and drop into sleep so quickly I hardly notice the thrumming that's begun in my ears.	game/events/plot/prologue/day3.rpy	6	"[what]"
day3_night_dream_a20cefa7		...	game/events/plot/prologue/day3.rpy	27	"[what]"
day3_night_dream_9cc2c7ec		My ears ring loudly now, and my head's throbbing so hard I wince at the pain.	game/events/plot/prologue/day3.rpy	27	"[what]"
day3_night_dream_5c91a9aa		No. Not at the pain, at the light.	game/events/plot/prologue/day3.rpy	27	"[what]"
day3_night_dream_149f6eeb		The flickering is so bright. I thought I had closed my curtains?	game/events/plot/prologue/day3.rpy	27	"[what]"
day3_night_dream_a4cf96f6		And the heat is so intense. I can't sleep like this.	game/events/plot/prologue/day3.rpy	27	"[what]"
day3_night_dream_0a23570e		Or am I already sleeping? I must be dreaming...	game/events/plot/prologue/day3.rpy	27	"[what]"
day3_night_dream_f2972ed2		The sensations are already fading as my thoughts work to catch up, and the darkness of sleep reclaims me.	game/events/plot/prologue/day3.rpy	27	"[what]"
day4_night_0a76fe24		I finally did it today. I channeled for the first time in my life. At least, the first time on purpose.	game/events/plot/prologue/day4.rpy	5	"[what]"
day4_night_fc27c493		I'm still riding that high as I return to my room.	game/events/plot/prologue/day4.rpy	5	"[what]"
day4_night_ce0d2774		A part of me was convinced I didn't actually have what it takes to channel. But now it feels like I might have a shot to make it through this.	game/events/plot/prologue/day4.rpy	5	"[what]"
day4_night_5411d6d3		I'm not even surprised when the thrumming starts in my ears as I settle in to rest for the night.	game/events/plot/prologue/day4.rpy	5	"[what]"
day4_night_dream_a20cefa7		...	game/events/plot/prologue/day4.rpy	22	"[what]"
day4_night_dream_c8fe5697		Tonight my dreams take a different turn than usual.	game/events/plot/prologue/day4.rpy	22	"[what]"
day4_night_dream_aa37036a		My head hurts and my ears are still buzzing, but I'm a kid again.	game/events/plot/prologue/day4.rpy	22	"[what]"
day4_night_dream_3d3c3915		I got up early and snuck out before sunrise with my friends.	game/events/plot/prologue/day4.rpy	22	"[what]"
day4_night_dream_e106a3ad		We're going to go check out the old abandoned temple. It's a test of courage.	game/events/plot/prologue/day4.rpy	22	"[what]"
day4_night_dream_0f669b3b		Some of them believe there's an old which who lives here. One of them even believes they saw a ghost here once.	game/events/plot/prologue/day4.rpy	22	"[what]"
day4_night_dream_39b19431		But I'm not afraid. I told them they were stupid for believing in such childish things.	game/events/plot/prologue/day4.rpy	22	"[what]"
day4_night_dream_80282a15		Plus I've got a secret weapon in case any ghosts do try to sneak up on us.	game/events/plot/prologue/day4.rpy	22	"[what]"
day4_night_dream_042f4266		We met up outside my house and are now moving quietly through the empty streets.	game/events/plot/prologue/day4.rpy	22	"[what]"
day4_night_dream_23cd7143		The moon is so bright that it's not hard to see, and we all know our way around the neighborhood. It doesn't take long before we make it to the old temple.	game/events/plot/prologue/day4.rpy	22	"[what]"
day4_night_dream_c2d0c062		I lead the way with 3 other kids huddling close behind, but I've never really been this close to the temple before so I'm starting to lose my nerve a little.	game/events/plot/prologue/day4.rpy	22	"[what]"
day4_night_dream_4f9bafbe		The stonework on the ground is uneven and I stumble. I catch myself, but not before yelling a bit more loudly than I had intended.	game/events/plot/prologue/day4.rpy	22	"[what]"
day4_night_dream_7055945f		A light comes on in a nearby room, and we see her: it's the witch!	game/events/plot/prologue/day4.rpy	22	"[what]"
day4_night_dream_a77598dd		I jolt awake to find that it's already morning.	game/events/plot/prologue/day4.rpy	22	"[what]"
day5_night_5bf2de95		Tonight the thrumming begins earlier than before.	game/events/plot/prologue/day5.rpy	5	"[what]"
day5_night_6d6e91d3		I realize it's the same sensation I get when I push myself too hard to attune to the spirits. Except, different.	game/events/plot/prologue/day5.rpy	5	"[what]"
day5_night_ac2f947e		It's deeper, and somehow... more insistent.	game/events/plot/prologue/day5.rpy	5	"[what]"
day5_night_34cc7e20		It must be some sort of after-effect of working myself so hard in clases.	game/events/plot/prologue/day5.rpy	5	"[what]"
day5_night_c76cdaf2		Perhaps everyone feels this when they first start studying magic, but all the other students began study with private instructors when they were much younger.	game/events/plot/prologue/day5.rpy	5	"[what]"
day5_night_d521aeb1		In any case it's been such a consistent companion to me these last few nights that it's almost comforting.	game/events/plot/prologue/day5.rpy	5	"[what]"
day5_night_f70f23ae		I'm able to ignore it well enough that it doens't take long to fall asleep.	game/events/plot/prologue/day5.rpy	5	"[what]"
day5_night_dream_a20cefa7		...	game/events/plot/prologue/day5.rpy	29	"[what]"
day5_night_dream_241a7cd0		Through the now-familar buzzing that joins me in my dreams each night, I notice another sound layered on top of it. A crackling.	game/events/plot/prologue/day5.rpy	29	"[what]"
day5_night_dream_23a69aa3		The lights I've seen before are clearer. Reds and yellows and oranges.	game/events/plot/prologue/day5.rpy	29	"[what]"
day5_night_dream_dbdb5943		And a new sensation strikes me. I can smell Smoke.	game/events/plot/prologue/day5.rpy	29	"[what]"
day5_night_dream_e04db510		When the witch caught us I panicked and ran.	game/events/plot/prologue/day5.rpy	29	"[what]"
day5_night_dream_cf9828d9		I was holding the little artifice my parents use in their tavern.	game/events/plot/prologue/day5.rpy	29	"[what]"
day5_night_dream_d7fcbfbc		The building isn't so big, and there's not a lot of room for tables inside. So half of them are set up outside.	game/events/plot/prologue/day5.rpy	29	"[what]"
day5_night_dream_50d68636		But nights here can get real cold. So we've got a few of these artficial flames set up in cages all around the tables so folks can enjoy some warmth while they're eating.	game/events/plot/prologue/day5.rpy	29	"[what]"
day5_night_dream_9edb7fbf		But when I was so surprised I lost it. I must have dropped it while we were running.	game/events/plot/prologue/day5.rpy	29	"[what]"
day5_night_dream_f3b10e3f		Now I'm back at the abandoned temple. The artifice must have triggered and the long dead and untreated wood of the structure eagerly took to the flame.	game/events/plot/prologue/day5.rpy	29	"[what]"
day5_night_dream_1ef867c8		The flame grows and grows and consumes everything. I feel it coming to get me and I'm ready to accept it.	game/events/plot/prologue/day5.rpy	29	"[what]"
day6_763a53d7		I'm so worked up I'm awake before the sun's fully risen.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	5	"[what]"
day6_b873939c		Today's the day.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	5	"[what]"
day6_e51c6728		Today I take the exam that decides my future at this academy. Or more accurately, whether I have any future at all here.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	5	"[what]"
day6_64fe263e		I... don't know what I would do if I went home now. I don't really have any other prospects. My life was pretty aimless before. I know mom will be disappointed.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	5	"[what]"
day6_5c776de1		I don't know if I'm ready, given how behind I was at the start of the week I'm honestly pretty worried.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	5	"[what]"
day6_5ac5c868		I've learned a lot and I'm sure I can demonstrate that. I just have to hope that that's enough.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	5	"[what]"
day6_94bd5669		But the anxiety of it all is still getting to me. No matter how much I pep myself up I can't shake this sinking feeling in my gut.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	5	"[what]"
day6_b35280d5		The exam won't start for a little while but longer I'm too antsy to stay in my room.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	5	"[what]"
day6_a550ba27		I step out into the courtyard and the smell hits me first.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	30	"[what]"
day6_95b1f42b		Smoke.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	30	"[what]"
day6_761f4940		Off in the distance towards town, I can see a faint plume of gray. I have a terrible feeling about this.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	30	"[what]"
day6_23e17891		There's no way for a fire to make it all the way up to the campus, but something is bothering me.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	30	"[what]"
day6_1f5cff64		The smoke, it's coming from the northeastern corner. I think back to my experiences exploring the town.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	30	"[what]"
day6_c357ab48		There's a residential area there and... the shrine?	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	30	"[what]"
day6_e029847d		My memories of my dreams come to me. The shrine caught fire? But that was just a dream.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	30	"[what]"
day6_6e2387be		I need to go check, but the exam will begin soon, there's no time.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	30	"[what]"
day6_exam_or_save_724dd975		That's right. I have been preparing for this exam all week. If I went into town now I'd surely miss it and risk my attendance here.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	65	"[what]"
day6_exam_or_save_e1e06707		I start to head to the hall where the exam will be held but I hesitate.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	65	"[what]"
day6_exam_or_save_cc3b5acd		I can't do it. I need to know.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	65	"[what]"
day6_exam_or_save_0bb09ab2		I can't shake this feeling that I need to go, I need to be there.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	76	"[what]"
day6_exam_or_save_722e2a21		But I can't risk missing the exam. And so what if the shrine burns? No one even uses it.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	76	"[what]"
day6_exam_or_save_6d434510		Except... the Shrinekeeper. In my dream she was still in there.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	76	"[what]"
day6_exam_or_save_4907bcfd		It doesn't make any sense, even if there was a fire, and even if it happened to be at that old temple, she would have made it out by now. Dreams aren't real.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	76	"[what]"
day6_exam_or_save_454488b7		I turn to head to the hall where the exam will be held.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	76	"[what]"
day6_exam_or_save_cc1081b2		"Save them."	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	76	"[what]"
day6_exam_or_save_97a75d2f		I can't do it. If there's any chance they're in danger, I have to go.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	76	"[what]"
day6_race_1201ed97		I sprint into town, rehersing the route to the temple in my head.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	99	"[what]"
day6_race_a72da611		I'm ready to feel like an idiot. There's probably no fire at all, some idiot just had a tragic grilling blunder and the shrine will be there just as before: an island kept afloat by a sole keeper in a sea of that rundown temple.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	99	"[what]"
day6_race_a64e2a6c		Even if there is a fire, what are the odds it's made its way to the temple?	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	99	"[what]"
day6_race_69d54155		Anything to keep my mind off of the fact that by running this far into town already, I have no hope of making it back in time for the start of the exam.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	99	"[what]"
day6_race_1dde69d5		By the time I get to the temple, it's too late. The whole thing is ablaze, the western wing is already collapsed and smouldering.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	114	"[what]"
day6_race_4ea76e6d		I just have to hope the Shrinekeeper made it out OK. She must have, right?	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	114	"[what]"
day6_race_64d0dd97		Besides I'm powerless, here. There's nothing I could do even if I wanted to.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	114	"[what]"
day6_race_964eab62		I feel it again. The thrumming.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	123	"[what]"
day6_race_f448c32b		I'm not powerless. I've been working my ass off all week.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	123	"[what]"
day6_race_a65f82e3		Forget the exam. Here and now. This is my test.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	123	"[what]"
day6_race_cff526a8		Water, what else?	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	135	"[what]"
day6_race_73d3f126		I recall the feeling of jumping in the fountain. Being soaked all the way through. Water dripping from my clothes, down my hair, covering my whole body, and I will the spirits, please.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	135	"[what]"
day6_race_a6a9eb75		And thank them, they respond.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	135	"[what]"
day6_race_1ebc1e09		In a rush I'm drenched, water falls to the ground around me and push on.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	135	"[what]"
day6_race_2d347eaf		 Kinesis. I don't know where I'll find the Shrinekeeper but the temple is falling apart and I can't get close enough to the burning structures to move them myself so I'll need to rely on the spirits for help. 	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	149	"[what]"
day6_rescue_4b329e33		I rush through the threshold of the temple gate, the flames haven't quite reached it yet but I can feel the heat from here.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	159	"[what]"
day6_rescue_2916ceb2		The water rapidly evaporating off of me keeps me from feeling the brundt of the heat.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	164	"[what]"
day6_rescue_e37178b2		The heat and smoke is so intense, I begin to cough.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	167	"[what]"
day6_rescue_60c432f5		Where is she? I think back to my dream. The east wing, her room was there.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	170	"[what]"
day6_rescue_4e23bfd0		I don't have time to find the entrance to the building proper; for all I know it's already collapsed or engulfed by flames.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	170	"[what]"
day6_rescue_8125cc8e		But I remember the window. I rush along the outside of the building to where I saw the light in my dreams.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	170	"[what]"
day6_rescue_6d9277c1		There!	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	170	"[what]"
day6_rescue_b7078049		I recall the feeling of setting [wg.name()]'s window into place. The heft of the pane against the frame, the joints where it snapped into place.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	183	"[what]"
day6_rescue_62667d5b		I don't doubt the window's construction in this temple differs wildly from those back in our dorm room, but surely the spirits can cut me some slack on this?	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	183	"[what]"
day6_rescue_a6a9eb75		And thank them, they respond.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	183	"[what]"
day6_rescue_0eedf705		I watch as the window flexes, and shatters, and a rush of hot air rushes out.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	183	"[what]"
day6_rescue_de04e554		owie	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	195	"[what]"
day6_rescue_a2a4e25c		The room is thankfully not itself burning, but it's filled with smoke.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	198	"[what]"
day6_rescue_60943459		I leap through, covering my mouth and face with my shirt, looking frantically around. I don't see the shrinekeeper anyway, but notice the door is open.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	198	"[what]"
day6_rescue_122d289e		I rush out into the hall and see her. The old woman looks so frail lying in the hall, I can't tell if she's breathing.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	198	"[what]"
day6_rescue_6272b049		I lift her in my arms and carry her back to the window.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	198	"[what]"
day6_rescue_2dc19651		I have to push out the remaining sharp edges of the shattered glass before I can push her out the window and follow after.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	198	"[what]"
day6_rescue_e9f21470		I rush to carry her away from the burning remains of the temple and towards fresh air.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	198	"[what]"
day6_rescue_a20cefa7		...	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	198	"[what]"
day6_rescue_80e680b3		I make it our of the temple entrance and onto the street which by now is filled with onlookers.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	198	"[what]"
day6_rescue_2f308f7f		I put the Shrinekeeper onto the ground, my strength finally failing me, and inspect her.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	198	"[what]"

day6_morning_take2_a7f7740d		Ready? To leave? I suppose it's obvious they will have noted my absense and have just assumed I chickened out. So they've already begun the expulsion process, but I hope they'll still be receptive to my request.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	420	"[what]"

day6_morning_take2_9e2b792c	"Administrator"	I'm shocked, to be quite honest. Your fundamentals professor spoke highly of your efforts. He said you'd made respectable progress given your limited background.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	434	"Administrator" "[what]"
day6_morning_take2_61f1f857	"Administrator"	I don't know if you've just gotten cold feet or we've just been a bit too successful in scaring you kids into taking this exam seriously, but you're going to march out into the exam hall and steel yourself to give it your all.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	434	"Administrator" "[what]"

day6_morning_take2_06ee48c0		What had the time spirit told me? They said I had an exam to take. That didn't make sense to me before, I thought they were speaking metaphorically.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	452	"[what]"
day6_morning_take2_2dd45d3d		But no, this is what they meant by helping me. They somehow sent me back in time.	game/events/plot/prologue/day6.rpy	452	"[what]"

unscheduled_morning_encounter_administrators_discussing_special_cases_5ff06899_1	"Admin2"	Excellent. The one chosen by the navigator's guild is especially powerful.

theory_lesson1_548cb782		I'm so focused on the effect that I miss what he does next, but everything suddenly grows dark as the curtains are pulled over the windows all across the room. A few students scream as they can't contain their surpsise.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	76	"[what]"
theory_lesson1_b674cdd7		We sit in darkness and silence for several long moments before a focused beam of light shines onto the front of the room where the professor is standing. Then another, and another, three lights in all shining on him from the corners of the room.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	76	"[what]"
theory_lesson1_f170b27b		I wait for his next move but he just looks up. I follow his gaze and am greeted by a dozen small rainbows flickering in the mist.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	76	"[what]"
theory_lesson1_cac52efd		After a few more moments of quiet, the curtains open wide and the effect fades.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	76	"[what]"
theory_lesson1_cc33fcd9		The professor is still standing in the front of the room, breathing heavily with a massive grin on his face, clearly having enjoyed his own performance.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	76	"[what]"
theory_lesson1_323ef484		He then takes a bow and I join the rest of the class in applause.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	76	"[what]"
theory_lesson1_8003224f	ti.says	Hahaha, damn. That always takes it out of me but it's worth it to impress you lot.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	110	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson1_bdf32ed8		He laughs while he works to catch his breath.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	112	"[what]"
theory_lesson1_b2a0adc5	ti.says	My little show there only made use of five of the six elements; I haven't managed to work in a compelling demonstration of life energy yet.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	114	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson1_4da8bc9b	ti.says	So what have we learned besides that I am an incorrigable show-off?	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	114	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson1_19a7b9f4	ti.says	Well any of you who are already a bit practiced will know that it's actually quite difficult to switch quickly between the different elements, but you may not understand why. Let's get into the details and see if we can work it out.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	114	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson1_ac6f01fe	ti.says	The process of channeling can be summarized in three steps:	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	114	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson1_1558171b	ti.says	First, Attunement. You must attune yourself to the spiritual energy in question. This is hardest when you first attune yourself to a specific element, but it becomes easier and easier through repitiion until it is second nature.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	114	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson1_cf21000b	ti.says	Second, Recall. You must recall the effect you are trying to create. This is key and where most students misstep. It is not enough to understand what the effect is, or how it looks, but you must evoke the experience of it to be able to materialize it again.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	114	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson1_67fba64b	ti.says	To those of you who are newer to this, yes this means you can only channel phenomena with magic that you have experienced firsthand.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	114	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson1_ad2bc114	ti.says	In your other classes you will practice with simple, easily reproduceable experiences to reinfoce this process.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	114	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson1_800754c5	ti.says	Lastly, you must feed that experience with the mana from within you. The spiritual energies provide us with a template to follow, a mold to fill, but the material to fuel it comes from your own mana.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	114	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson1_9ac5e450	ti.says	These steps each get easier through practice, but it is particularly challanging to switch from attuning one element to another. The mental dexterity it requires to perform this transition smoothly is a skill all of its own.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	114	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson1_ecaea8ee	ti.says	Which is to say, I am very impressive. You may now applaud again.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	114	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson1_38b6a734	ti.says	Thank you for your attention. That concludes our lecture for this morning.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	151	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson1_590d72b6	ti.says	After noon you will find each of the subject matter instructors will be hosting introductory lessons on their respective spiritual element of study.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	151	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson1_13e3db8e	ti.says	These will be hosted each day this week so feel free to attend them in any order you like. These lessons are not mandatory so feel free to self-study or take a walk about town if you prefer, it is a lovely day after all, but don't neglect preparing for your exams.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	151	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson2_d61dc25c	ti.says	Welcome back to arcane fundamentals class! Last time we discussed the spiritual elements and the process of channeling them in the abstract. Today we'll begin our study on channeling by focusing on the first step: Attunement.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	173	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson2_e79fc8f9		Some of the class emits an audible groan.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	177	"[what]"
theory_lesson2_465d1208	ti.says	Yes, some of you will already be familiar with these drills. We will not be chanelling any complete spells today, feel free to practice at your own pace outside of my class.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	179	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson2_f915a9b1		Understanding catching up to me, I'm a little disappointed as well, but I suspect I could benefit from these drills more than anyone else in class so I shouldn't be ungrateful.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	182	"[what]"
theory_lesson2_089ec5cc	ti.says	Because Attunement is a skill that more than any other improves through repitition, our exercises today will practice attuning to a single element repeatedly to develop that familiarity.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	185	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson2_0d789b01		I focus on the spiritual energies of [intro_chosen_element]. When I start off, the sensation is surprisingly familiar, a slight humming throughout my body.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	205	"[what]"
theory_lesson2_1736f9a1		I have never intentionally channeled before, but I have once or twice done so on accident when I was particularly emotionally charged. I'm pleasently surprised that it feels natural already.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	205	"[what]"
theory_lesson2_8b092df6		After a while the effort starts to give me a headache.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	205	"[what]"
theory_lesson2_12ce3dda		My headach gets much more intense, but I keep performing the drills.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	220	"[what]"
theory_lesson2_9ea37c90		I take a short break and feel my headache subside. I continue the drills.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	228	"[what]"
theory_lesson2_8ba909af	ti.says	Most students by the time they're in their second year specialize in one of the elements. This is in large part due to how potent it is to dedicate your studies to attuning to a single element quickly and efficiently.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	231	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson2_0126130e	ti.says	You don't need to make such a decision immediately, it will probably do you good to have a more generalized grounding so you don't limit your options. But for now, as you're getting started, do stick to any one element as you continue to practice.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	231	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson2_75449cdf		There isn't that much time left in class and my effort has begun to tire me out.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	241	"[what]"
theory_lesson2_ddd6e95a		The headache comes back, more intensely than before.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	244	"[what]"
theory_lesson2_8c746d3c		My persistent headache, which I've managed to ignore so far, grows near unbearable.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	246	"[what]"
theory_lesson2_602f8ece		I push to continue my drills despite the throbbing and buzzing in my ears.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	252	"[what]"
theory_lesson2_3d4b649a		I can only manage it for a little while before I collapse exhausted until class ends.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	257	"[what]"
theory_lesson2_edb655c0		I release my concentration and relief hits me immediately, though my headache doesn't go away completely by the time class ends.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	260	"[what]"
theory_lesson3_3c630d60	ti.says	Welcome back to arcane fundamentals class! Last time we covered attunement in more detail. Today we'll be focusing on the second phase of channeling: Recall.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	273	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson3_8846f9ec		I'm a little hesitant after pushing myself so hard last time, but I can't help but be excited.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	276	"[what]"
theory_lesson3_a8f6f4bb	ti.says	The recall step in channeling imposes a limitation on your abilities that no amount of study or practice can overcome. Great Magi improve their repetoire through a long and varied life experiences. In a way, true masters of the art are avid students of life itself.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	278	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson3_615d8bc9		The professor looks pensive for a moment.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	282	"[what]"
theory_lesson3_8841cb80	ti.says	That was awfully deep, wasn't it? Well don't go getting any bright ideas about rushing out of here to go living life to the fullest. If I'm stuck inside here, you are too.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	284	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson3_e0e59884	ti.says	The fact is that while life experiences are a necessary component, they are by no means sufficient. Which means more drills!	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	284	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson3_45d79c38	ti.says	Today we'll again limit our attention and improve through repetition. Focus on a memory of a simple physical phenomenon that aligns to one of the spiritual elements.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	284	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson3_51eb3677	ti.says	If you don't already have an experience in mind, I suggest you try lifting your pencil and dropping it several times. Then focus on the experience of the pencils motion before attuning yourself to the energies of Kinesis.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	284	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson3_64dabf41		Not having any better ideas, and feeling a bit foolish, I begin repeatedly dropping my pencil.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	299	"[what]"
theory_lesson3_ddb6ec49		I try to focus on the imagery of watching it fall. The rate at which it falls, the sounds of it clattering, the way it bounces chaotically on my desk.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	299	"[what]"
theory_lesson3_b1cf6202		Then I attune to Kinesis and try recalling that experience.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	299	"[what]"
theory_lesson3_99cefffd		Nothing happens at first, which isn't too surprising, but I soon grow frustrated with my lack of progress and start fiddling with the pencil again.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	299	"[what]"
theory_lesson3_ec0bfb8b	ti.says	Remember, if you're trying to explore Kinesis, focus both on the pencil rising and falling. In particular you're the one lifting the pencil so you'll have a more intimate connection to that experience.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	311	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson3_16ae11c2		I try again with the Professor's advice in mind and it doesn't take too long before I start to feel something.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	315	"[what]"
theory_lesson3_3da54b3f		I've been attuning this whole time so the familiar humming is back, but now I feel like I can see the motion of the pencil in space, rising gently above my desk then tumbling again.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	315	"[what]"
theory_lesson3_f9c9eec6		We keep the drills up throughout class, the professor offering more helpful hints.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	323	"[what]"
theory_lesson4_871613ff	ti.says	Welcome back to arcane fundamentals class! Today will be the final day of our exploration of the mechanics of channeling as we discuss infusing our spell with Mana.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	335	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson4_9b94f77c		This is probably the subject I'm most familiar with so far.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	338	"[what]"
theory_lesson4_4da6e964	ti.says	Man I'm so uncofident about this mana thing.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	340	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson4_cfbd11d8	ti.says	Mana is another concept with some traditional understanding that we've discovered to be incomplete with more research into the field.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	340	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson4_32cc448a	ti.says	It is a energy of living things. You can use it to magic. You can also use it to not magic.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	340	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson5_57b4ef43	ti.says	Today is the last day of our series on Arcane Fundamentals.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	356	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson5_0381c97c	ti.says	Rather than focusing the lecture on any specific subject, today will be student guided. If you have any questions or areas you want elaboration on now is your chance to ask them before your exams tomorrow.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	356	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson5_d58821b6		We spend the class reviewing a number of concepts and clarifying channeling techniques.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	364	"[what]"
theory_lesson5_43b9a8af	ti.says	Before we conclude, does anyone have any final questions?	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	368	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson5_076125c8		Many of the other students around me look bored or half-asleep, but for me the novelty hasn't worn off. My mind is reeling from how much we've learned in just one week. This puts many of my experiences into perspective, but something about this explanation feels off.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	370	"[what]"
theory_lesson5_cc9bbc8e		When it finally clicks and I shoot my hand into the air.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	370	"[what]"
theory_lesson5_a74f5fbf	ti.says	Yes, a question in the back?	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	378	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson5_9f166ed5	mc.says	Professor, you've covered a lot on spiritural energy, but what about the spirits themselves?	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	380	mc.says "[what]"
theory_lesson5_19495240	ti.says	Ah, an interesting line of inquiry. One that many have devoted their lives to researching with... inconsistent results.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	383	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson5_c134e97e	ti.says	This is a subject I've glossed over in the interest of time but I'm glad you've asked and you deserve an answer.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	383	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson5_e4cd6504	ti.says	To cut to the heart of your question, you seek to personify the energies we call upon in our practice of magic. Many traditional belief systems teach of these beings we call "the spirits", give them will, give them agency.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	383	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson5_097be529	ti.says	But our way here is of empiricism. We conclude only what we can see, what we can touch, what we can measure.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	383	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson5_326532de	ti.says	It's not that magi have disproven the existence of spirits, per se. It's just that the question is ill formed. We cannot know whether the the spirits have will anymore than we can know whether the earth or the sky or the chairs upon which you rest have will. Do they mind your rear end pressed upon them? Perhaps they fancy some more than others?	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	383	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson5_c603baf6	ti.says	Of course the spirits are where we get the modifier "spiritual" that we ascribe to this energy and how we channel it. Whether you interpret this as a linguistic holdover or literally is a matter of personal belief and not in the domain of these lectures.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	383	ti.says "[what]"
theory_lesson5_65e2d563		I shouldn't be but I'm still surprised by how differently people here consider the spirits than back home.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	406	"[what]"
theory_lesson5_6a8799b3		I'm not surprised to hear this perspective, and there is a logic to what he's saying. Maybe the spirits are just a superstitious interpretation of these energies.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	412	"[what]"
theory_lesson5_77044707		I can see what he's saying, but I've always been able to feel the spirits. It doesn't makes sense to deny that now.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	417	"[what]"
theory_lesson5_73f3790e	ti.says	I believe that's all the time we have. I wish you all the best of luck on your exams tomorrow. If you apply yourself as you've done in my class, I have no doubts you'll come out victorious.	game/events/school/theory_lessons.rpy	421	ti.says "[what]"
