This project is using the Ren'Py game engine.

It is based on the EasyRenpyGui project template by Feniksdev.

Currently this is the result of playing around with the engine features but should hopefully transform into a standalone game someday.

Most existing art assets are quickly generated from AI models or sketched out by hand.
Some are ripped without attribution from the internet and will be replaced soon with other placeholders.
